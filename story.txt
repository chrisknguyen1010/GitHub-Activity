Chris:
There once was a man who was travelling the world. He stumbled across a strange place in the middle of the ocean. 
Undiscovered, the island seemed uninhabited. He decided to rest here before he continued on his journey.

Grant:
In shock, he heard a noise in the forest. Out of curiosity, he had to go see what the strange sound was.
He decided that he could simply travel the world tomorrow. As he traversed deeper into the woods,
the man noticed that his vision started to dim. As he continued to see less and less, he realised that he 
was falling into a deep trance. When he woke up from the slumber, he saw...

Jack:
A grizzled young man standing in front of him. They were both in the middle of the forest, hiding behind a 
bush. The young man explained to the traveler that an evil wizard lives on the island and tried luring the 
traveler into the forest in order to knock him out with a spell and potentially kill him. But the young man, 
seeing the event unfold, managed to intervene and save the traveler. The young man said his plane crashed and 
was stuck on the island for the past 3 days. The traveler then offered the young man to accompany him on his 
voyage around the world for saving him. The young man agreed, and they continued on the journey.

Alex:
As they began to leave the island, a storm cloud gathered above them, blocking out the sun. The two
adventurures ran to the shore to find the wooden boat that had brought the traveler there. To their 
surprise, the wizard was standing on the boat. They lept on to the wizard and threw him in to the water,
drowning his screams in the rush of the ocean. Together the young man and the traveler set of to find
new uncharted territory, free from the wizard's prying eyes.
